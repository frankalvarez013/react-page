  //Also if you don't have id, use fetchPet - line below

  //The first thing you give to useQuery is the query key. It could be a string e.g. we could have done details:1 as the key for details 1
  //(similar to a Redis strategy for key naming.) However I like the array methodology. You can give it an array of keys. So the first key is
  //details and then a subkey of that is 1 and it has to match both. You can also do it with objects and we will momentarily.
